According to a new report circulating around the internet, and purportedly based on Korean sources, both Samsung and LG will be forgoing 4K smartphone displays next year, instead focusing on the QHD panels already in production.</p><img src="http://cdn02.androidauthority.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/4K-display-resolution.jpg"></article>]]></description>

It's not clear, but Tesla and Elon Musk are certainly giving it a go. The company has published a " correction" to a story yesterday in Bloomberg Businessweek about former iPhone hacker George Hotz reportedly creating his own self-driving car software in his garage.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6b392ee764297216454c3b289074bc602562f593.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Hands-On With Microsoft's HoloLens, One Year Later</h1><p>One year after showing off HoloLens, Microsoft's augmented reality rig remains very much a work in progress. It's not a virtual reality rig, it's something entirely different. Just what it is, though, will be up to the software developers who'll truly define the device.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/77222e9080a7ddc5ead039f87534f800b4973d69.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Why Facebook is scared of Android</h1><p>A series of discussions between Google and Facebook took place over the course of this summer, and Facebook walked away from them a little shaky.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>I tried Microsoft's 'holographic' headset, and I'm convinced this is the future</h1><p>It's been nearly a year since Microsoft surprised everyone by announcing the HoloLens, a sort of helmet-computer that projects virtual images on top of the real world around you. Microsoft calls them holograms, even if that term is technically incorrect. Some people call it mixed reality. Others call it augmented reality.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e6e9f7ca98c0367f67f803f88332115232fba90e.jpg"></article>]]></description>
