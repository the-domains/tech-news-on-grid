            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>This guy on Product Hunt has just killed Facebook's business model</h1><p>A Chrome extension from serial dev Juraj Ivan has just gone live on Product Hunt with the goal of getting rid of any unwanted Facebook posts by filtering to only show posts by your friends and updates from pages you follow.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Hands-On With Microsoft's HoloLens, One Year Later</h1><p>One year after showing off HoloLens, Microsoft's augmented reality rig remains very much a work in progress. It's not a virtual reality rig, it's something entirely different. Just what it is, though, will be up to the software developers who'll truly define the device.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/77222e9080a7ddc5ead039f87534f800b4973d69.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>I tried Microsoft's 'holographic' headset, and I'm convinced this is the future</h1><p>It's been nearly a year since Microsoft surprised everyone by announcing the HoloLens, a sort of helmet-computer that projects virtual images on top of the real world around you. Microsoft calls them holograms, even if that term is technically incorrect. Some people call it mixed reality. Others call it augmented reality.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e6e9f7ca98c0367f67f803f88332115232fba90e.jpg"></article>]]></description>
